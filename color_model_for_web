Color mixing model for the web

 @my-color: blue + pink

 blue + pink == blue 50% + pink 50%

 or you could

 blue 75% + pink 25%

 so on and so forth

 color is translated to RGB

 pink -> #ffc0cb
 blue -> #0000ff

 255, 192, 203 (pink)
 00, 00, 255 (blue)

 at 50% would be

 127.5, 96, 101.5
 0, 0, 127.5

 added together would be

 127.5, 96, 229

 which is

 #8060e5, a lovely shade of purple.

 Yeah!

 And than you can mix with @my-color.
